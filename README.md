## [Simulation #1 (Neural Encoding)](https://github.com/AryaKoureshi/Advanced-Topics-in-Neuroscience/tree/main/Neural-Encoding/Simulation%231)
This assignment is divided into two main sections, each dealing with a different type of neuron model.
### Integrate and Fire Neuron
Here we are going to simulate spike trains based on [Softky & Koch, 1993] and compare its statistics with real neural data. The simplest neuron model in this paper was a kind of integrate and fire neuron where itâ€™s inter-spike intervals (ISI) distribution explained by equation [9].
### Leaky Integrate and Fire Neuron
In this section we are going to implement a more realistic model of neuron, Leaky Integrate and fire (LIF) neuron, which consider the leakage of postsynaptic inputs. 
The leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron is probably one of the simplest spiking neuron models, but it is still very popular due to the ease with which it can be analyzed and simulated.

## [Simulation #2 (Neural Encoding)](https://github.com/AryaKoureshi/Advanced-Topics-in-Neuroscience/tree/main/Neural-Encoding/Simulation%232)
### Aim
Studying the population response structure
### Description
Uncertainty is a ubiquitous component of our environment, such that humans and animals are regularly confronted with conditions that vary in degrees of uncertainty. It is therefore a fundamental requirement of our brain systems to accurately process uncertain information so that we may function appropriately, both in our mundane day-to-day activities and in more profound moments. Many brain regions including the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala, parietal cortex, cingulate cortex, and insular cortex have been identified as key areas in processing information about uncertain rewards. In this assignment we are going to analyze the activity of a population of single units recorded with multi-electrode array in Parietal cortex. The task is designed to study the encoding of reward expected value in area 7a. This area encodes the spatial location of cue.
