## Simulation #1 (Neural Encoding)
This assignment is divided into two main sections, each dealing with a different type of neuron model.
### Integrate and Fire Neuron
Here we are going to simulate spike trains based on [Softky & Koch, 1993] and compare its statistics with real neural data. The simplest neuron model in this paper was a kind of integrate and fire neuron where itâ€™s inter-spike intervals (ISI) distribution explained by equation [9].
### Leaky Integrate and Fire Neuron
In this section we are going to implement a more realistic model of neuron, Leaky Integrate and fire (LIF) neuron, which consider the leakage of postsynaptic inputs. 
The leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron is probably one of the simplest spiking neuron models, but it is still very popular due to the ease with which it can be analyzed and simulated.
